## Final Project: Simple-GUI

#### [Video Demo](https://youtu.be/2ttKNype9nI)

### Description:

The **Simple-GUI** project was my final submission for CS50. This project is a Java-based application that manages Customers, Products, and Orders.

### Key Features:

- **MVC/Clean Architecture:** The project is structured using MVC and Clean Architecture principles to maintain modularity and improve code reusability.
- **DAO Design Pattern:** Implemented the DAO pattern to abstract the database operations for better maintainability.
- **MySQL Database:** I chose MySQL to handle the back-end data, utilizing advanced features like triggers and SQL SIGNALs for stock management.



### How to Set Up

1. Install MySQL 8.0.31.
2. Run the [database script](./Final%20Project/project/database/script.txt) to set up the schema.
3. Add the required libraries ([rs2xml](./lib/rs2xml.jar) and [mysql-connector](./lib/mysql-connector-j-8.2.0.jar)) as project dependencies.
